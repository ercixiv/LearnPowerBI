# Power BI Learning

Hello,  
  
This is my personal repository to store my attempts at learning Power BI, SQL and Data Analysis.  
My goal is to attempt to store most of what I learned and create documentation.
  
  
First off,  
### MS Learning Collection
In my opinion, the learn modules from microsoft is extensive and may even reveal features you have overlooked.  
It's a good place to start. Here is my MS learn collection. The order is based on the PL-300 exam topics.

## Data

### Official MS samples
You can get plenty of sample data on the internet to play with, but a good start would be using microsoft's official desktop samples.

Most of the topics in MS Learn modules can be practiced using the AdventureWorks Sales sample.

### SQL server express
Learning T-SQL is another option. SQL Express is a local db installed in your computer where you can practice querying data from RDBMS. I will update this topic in the future.
