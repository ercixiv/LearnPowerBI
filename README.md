# Power BI Learning

Hello,  
  
This is my personal repository to store my attempts at learning Power BI, SQL and Data Analysis.  
My goal is to attempt to store most of what I learned and create documentation.
  
  
First off, 
### MS Learning Collection
In my opinion, the learn modules from microsoft is extensive and may even reveal features you have overlooked.  
It's a good place to start. Here is my MS learn collection. The order is based on the PL-300 exam topics.
